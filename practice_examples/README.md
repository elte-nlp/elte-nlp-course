## Practice material for the course (WIP)

This folder contains the practice material for the course. The material contains example notebooks and extra files for that. Each practice is designed to be a standalone Google Colab notebook. (Exceptions will be clearly marked.) The notebooks tap into topics explained in the lectures but they are not in a 1:1 relationship with the lecture material. Following the order of them is recommended, but not mandatory.

Each example comes with a video to explain the content. The videos are available on the following link: [OneDrive](https://ikelte-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/natabara_inf_elte_hu/EuxprlnO8Q9HqxCc08hG8zEBRDiQcTMmrg3PpVPQ-jufyQ?e=wqpUTO)

Practice material extension is still in progress. The material will be updated and extended. In case of any questions feel free to open an issue in the repository.
